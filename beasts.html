            <p>Beast Transformations for Saiyans,Wizards & Ninjas</p><br>
        </div>

        <div class="normal">
            <p>Beasts are transformations which a character can get and use in a fight. A beast gives its user additional moves which are not in his/her card originally. When one has a beast it has to be summoned before it's moves can be used.</p>
            <p>A beast can be obtained by beating it in a battle</p><br>
            <p>Ninjas have the Tailed Beasts, Wizards have the Dragons while Saiyans have the Oozarus(Great Apes). There are many different beasts with different strengths and abilities.</p><br>
            <p>A player with a beast can be challenged to a battle for that beast, if the weilder agrees and loses, he/she loses their beast to the challenger. A weilder can choose to accept or decline the challenge.</p><br>
            <p>Even in a beast mode, one can still use their original skills/moves/jutsus.</p><br>
            <p>When battling a beast, that beast has an unlimited attack which is not part of it's skill card called nom attack. The nom attack can be used as long as the beast does not have an owner. The nom attack for ninja beasts give 2hp damage while that of the beasts of wizards & saiyans give 3hp damage.</p><br>
            <p>When a beast battle is ongoing and the number of turns has reached 15, the beast regains all its used skills back, this also occurs at an arithmetic rate of turns (i.e turn 30, turn 45, etc).</p><br>
            <p>The Health and Charge points of an unowned beast is stated on the skill card on this site, as well as the amount of hp & cp gained when it is summoned by an owner.</p><br>
            <p>The amount of health and cp of a beast doubles when it faces 2 people and triples when facing 3. The max number of people that can face one beast at a time is 3.</p><br>
            <p>Ninja beasts can only be summoned after the 3rd turn, Wizards at 5th turn and Saiyan beasts can only be summoned when your health is what it will be if your divide your original health by 1.5.</p><br>
            <p>Fighting a beast and losing will mean you either lose 50 crowns or 5xp(you choose), and the effects of death battle takes place.</p><br>
            <p>A player can only have one beast at a time.</p><br>
