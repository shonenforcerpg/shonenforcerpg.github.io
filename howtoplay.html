            <h1><b>How To Play</b></h1>
            <p>Learn how the game is played, how to improve and how to strategise</p><br><br>
        </div> 
        <div class="normal">
            <p>This is a role-play game, meaning you will have a character card which has a select number of moves/skills.</p> <br>
            <p>There are four races to choose from. The races, their benefits and drawbacks are listed below. After going through the races and selecting the one you would like, you message an admin with your choice then a card is made for you to use.</p><br>
            <h4>Saiyan</h4>
            <p>This is an attack-minded race. People of this race focus more on power than on defence. They have the highest initial health(15) but the lowest initial charge points(10).</p><br>
            <h4>Ninja</h4>
            <p>The people of this race are more strategic, they are more focused on defending and countering smartly than on using pure power. They have the highest initial charge points(15), but the lowest initial health(10).</p><br>
            <h4>Wizard</h4>
            <p>A mix between being focused on power and being defensive and cautious. They can be either power minded or defensive minded. They have the third highest health(13) and the joint second highest charge points(12).</p><br>
            <h4>Quirk-Human</h4>
            <p>This race is very similar to the wizard race, in being a mix between attack and defence although this race is a little more attack focused. They have the second highest health(14) and the joint second highest charge points(12).</p><br>

            <p>To play, you use the moves given to you in your card to perform various actions, there will be a script which will indicate your health, cp and some other information relevant to the battle. The main aim of a battle is to completely deplete an opponent's health(i.e to 0). To play a move you type it out as it is in your card.</p><br>
            <p><b>Terms:</b></p><br>
            <p><b>Card - </b>This holds your skills/moves. This is what you use in-battle. When you first join, you have a card that has 6 moves & 8 slots(a slot can be bought with 15xp, max number of slots is varies with race). Every player has a card, do not show other players your card(except from admins) so your moves will not be predictable.</p><br>
            <p><b>Skills/Moves/Justu - </b>These are what you use in battle. You use the moves given in your card to fight. Moves can also be bought using xp. There are special moves(KKG) which cannot be bought and cannot be changed when you are given in your card.</p><br>
            <p><b>Battle - </b>This is a fight between players in the game, there are different types of battles, including one-on-one, two-on-two(tag team), friendly battle, death batlle, beast battle, tounament battle, etc. A battle is won when a player reduces his/her opponenets health to zero.</p><br>
            <p><b>Health(HP) - </b>This differs depending on your race(more about this in the <a href="races.html">Races & Homelands</a>  section). This is an essential factor because if an opponent depletes this completely during a battle, that battle is lost.</p><br>
            <p><b>Charge Points(CP) - </b>This is the amount of energy one has. This is needed to perform most moves, it also differs depending on your race. If your cp drops to zero during a battle, you can skip a turn and gain 2cp, but you lose 2hp in the process as well. Chakra(for Ninjas), Ki(for Saiyans), Magic(for Wizards), Energy(for Quirk-Humans) and others are collectively known as charge points.</p><br>
            <p><b>XP - </b>This is the in-game monetary system, xp is gotten from win ning battles & can also be bought using real money(₦100 for 5xp).</p><br>
            <p><b>Crowns - </b>These are needed to level up your character rank, crowns are gotten from winning battles. Increasing your rank increases the amount of health and chargee points you have at the start of a battle.</p><br>
            <p align="center"><b>Ranks are as Follows</b></p><br>
