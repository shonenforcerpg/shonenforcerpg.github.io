            <p>This is a role-play game, meaning you will have a character card which has a select number of moves/skills. A card is gotten from an admin.</p> <br>
            <p><b>Terms:</b></p><br>
            <p><b>Card - </b>This holds your skills/moves. This is what you use in-battle. When you first join, you have a card that has 6 moves & 8 slots(a slot can be bought with 10xp, max number of slots is varies with race). Every player has a card, do not show other players your card(except from admins) so your moves will not be predictable.</p><br>
            <p><b>Skills/Moves/Justu - </b>These are what you use in battle. You use the moves given in your card to fight. Moves can also be bought using xp. There are special moves(KKG) which cannot be bought and cannot be changed when you are given in your card.</p><br>
            <p><b>Battle - </b>This is a fight between players in the game, there are different types of battles, including one-on-one, two-on-two(tag team), friendly battle, death batlle, beast battle, tounament battle, etc. A battle is won when a player reduces his/her opponenets health to zero.</p><br>
            <p><b>Health(HP) - </b>This differs depending on your race(more about this in the Races & Villages section). This is an essential factor because if an opponent depletes this completely during a battle, that battle is lost.</p><br>
            <p><b>Energy/Chakra Points(CP) - </b>This is the amount of energy one has. This is needed to perform most moves, it also differs depending on your race. If your cp drops to zero during a battle, you can skip a turn and gain 2cp, but you lose 2hp in the process as well.</p><br>
            <p><b>XP - </b>This is the in-game monetary system, xp is gotten from win ning battles & can also be bought using real money(₦100 for 5xp).</p><br>
            <p><b>Crowns - </b>These are needed to level up your character rank, crowns are gotten from winning battles. Increasing your rank increases the amount of health and chakra points you have at the start of a battle.</p><br>
            <p align="center"><b>Ranks are as Follows</b></p><br>
