                <p>There are 6 different type of skills, the skill type is stated in a bracket after the name of the skill. The 6 types are as follows;</p><br>

                <p>(atk): Attacking Skill: These skills give damage to players.</p><br>
                <p>(time): Time-Based Skill: These are skills that have effects which last for more than one turn.</p><br>
