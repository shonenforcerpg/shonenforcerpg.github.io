            <p>Introducing an all new battle system in Shonen Force. This new system encourages players to be more strategic in battle.</p><br>
            <p>In the new system, all players are allowed to fight friendly battles with anyone up until they reach the third rank. After which, every battle they fight will be a special type of death battle - Ranked Battles.</p><br>
            <p>In Ranked Battles, you are allowed to fight a maximum of 5 battles a day, although if you lose a battle, you are unable to fight any other battle for the rest of the day. You are allowed to fight one friendly battle every 3 days.</p><br>
