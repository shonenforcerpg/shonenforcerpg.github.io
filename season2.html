            <h3>Battle Pass(C) - An All New Currency</h3><br> <img src="img/in-game-currency.png" alt="in-game-currency" height="130" width="130" style="float: left;">
            <p>Introducing a new in-game currency to stand alongside the XP, this currency cannot be gotten by battling but can only be bought at the rate of ₦200 for 5C. This all new currency will give you access to buy some moves which would otherwise only be unlocked by achieving a certain rank, the ability to buy moves during tournament, senzu beans &amp; energy capsules during events, the ability to have 1 beast battle a week for a specific amount and gives bonuses from winning matches.</p><br>
            <h3>A New Battle System</h3> <img src="img/newbattles.png" alt="newbattles"><br>
            <p>Introducing an all new battle system in Shonen Force, more stakes are on the line now. This new system encourages players to be more strategic in battle.</p><br>
            <p>In the new system, all players are allowed to fight friendly battles with anyone up until they reach the third rank. After which, every battle they fight will be a special type of death battle - Ranked Battles.</p><br>
            <p>In Ranked Battles, you are allowed to fight a maximum of 5 times a day, although if you lose once, you are unable to fight for the rest of the day, also, you cannot fight those who are not in at least the third rank. You are allowed to fight one friendly battle every 3 days.</p><br>
            <p>Note: You cannot battle opponents more than 3 ranks below you.</p><br>

            <h3>Tournaments &amp; Events</h3><br> <img src="img/IMG-20200617-WA0000.jpg" alt="tournaments"><br>
            <p>Season 2 brings a full fledged league where all players will compete and face each other for the chance to win massive prizes, as well as bragging rights, all players will be rewarded at the end, no matter your position.</p><br>
            <p>There will also be periodic tournaments where 12 players who register will also compete for prizes.</p><br>
            <p>Season 2 will see the return of Event battles. Here you will plan with your teamates to face powerful opponents. Winning will bring about XP rewards, but losing will also have its consequences.</p><br>

            <h3>Beast &amp; Special Character Battles</h3><br>
            <p>Season 2 will allow, from time to time, players to face off against beasts for their respective races. A draw, to decide when and who will battle the beasts, will be held to give a fair chance to everyone who wishes to compete.</p><br>
            <p>Special Characters will also be unlocked and players will have their chance to face them according to their respective races.</p><br>
